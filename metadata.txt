name=Create Indexed Vector Grid
qgisMinimumVersion=2.0
description=Creates a vector polygon grid for indexing. This is similar to the existing Vector Grid functionality, except that cells are named using a spreadsheet-like coordinate system (such as A1, F3 etc). By spatially joining features to this grid, you can use Attribute Tables in Print Composer to give a street-atlas style index of features and their corresponding grid squares.
